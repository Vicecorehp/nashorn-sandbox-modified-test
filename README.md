# nashorn-sandbox-modified-test

## 1. Description
A personal project focused on how to use the delight-nashorn-sandbox with some test cases. 
It's a personal project and there is no copyright issues. Feel free to use.  
I'm really not so good at programming so I created this project helping me to understand Java deeply.  
It's known that Nashorn JavaScript has been deprecated on Java 21 platform. Maybe One day I will solve this problem by 
upgrading from Nashorn to Rhino or GraalVM Script Engine in order to enhance security and stability.
Maybe the upgrading work may also become a part of my company task...
